### Summary:
This repo contains code to create bots that can compete at aigaming.com.   
There's a branch for each game. Each branch will contain various scripts that each correspond to a bot.

#### Noughts and Crosses Results:

- Out of 100 matches against "housebot-practise", this bot won 84 and drew 16.   
- Out of 100 matches against "housebot-competition", this bot drew all 100.   
- There are no other players available to play against.   
- The site asks "How quickly can you create a bot that is never beatenb(but, unfortunately, will never win)?"   
- So I think this is the best solution.
